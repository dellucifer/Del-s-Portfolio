      "I had the privilege of working with Priyanshu when I served as the Student Co-ordinator for our college's software development club. Even then, his passion for technology, especially in the realm of cybersecurity, was evident and commendable. His depth of knowledge in this domain always stood out, making him a valuable asset to our team. Now, as the Student Co-ordinator, I've observed Priyanshu take on a pivotal role with zeal and dedication. Under his leadership, the club has not only thrived but has also seen a surge in activities and events, ensuring that the members are consistently exposed to the latest in the tech world. His knack for organization and his unwavering commitment to promoting technological literacy among his peers is truly commendable. I firmly believe that Priyanshu's unique combination of leadership skills and technical expertise makes him an asset to any team or project he undertakes. He is undoubtedly one of the brightest and most dedicated individuals I've had the pleasure of working with, and I wholeheartedly recommend him for any future endeavors.",

    testimonial:
      "Priyanshu has a zeal for cyber-security and is also a quick learner, so he can quickly adapt to any tech stack that is thrown at him. So he will be suited for mostly all the developer roles, but I think he would shine most in the cyber security space. Along with this, he has great leadership skills that he showed while managing the computer society of around 100 students.",
